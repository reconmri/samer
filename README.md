These scripts and data provide example code for the method described in:

Polak et al. 2021, "Scout Accelerated Motion Estimation and Correction (SAMER)"

To start run samer_main_script.m in MATLAB.

This example was most recently tested using MATLAB 2020a, and uses that versions's syntax for optimization settings. etc.

Key scripts

samer_main_script.m - This script performs the SAMER motion estimation and correction for various sampling schemes and low-resolution scout scans. In additon, the use coil compression and the effect of noisy k-space data can be explored.
